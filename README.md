# Kill Counter

Electron-based XP/Kill tracker for Flyff Universe.

## Download
Grab the **Setup** or **Portable** EXE from the [Releases](https://github.com/Syjster/kill_counterv2/releases).

## Usage
1. **Capture XP Bar** (hover your mouse over your Status Window shortcut T in Flyff U).
2. **Fine-Tune Capture** (Known bug puts window back, minimize all your open programs and you'll find it)→ adjust → **Apply**.
3. Make sure it Captures only the xp bar, hit "Debug" to see preview of the captured area.
3. **Start** to track, Stop=Pause, Reset=resets the counter
Tips:
1. Finetune Pixel and Capture numbers. For fast killers make the time shorter.
2. Make the Status bar not transparent. In Gold Theme Menu→Options→Interface→Opacity 100% or use Original Theme for non transparent Status window.
3. Pixel is the amount of pixel change it needs to count as kill, play around with this number, worked good for me with .5% (0.005 )

(Haven't tried AOE, Don't think it will work good with the method I'm using. Feel free to come with suggestions to track AOE as well!)

Happy Flyffing!
