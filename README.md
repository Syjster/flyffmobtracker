5. **Start** to track, Stop=Pause, Reset=resets the counter

Tips:
1. Manually calculate your xp/kill, insert number into "Total XP per Kill" to have it track "Total XP" & XP/h correcly.
2. Finetune Pixel and Capture numbers. For fast killers make the time shorter.
3. Make the Status bar not transparent. In Gold Theme Menu→Options→Interface→Opacity 100% or use Original Theme for non transparent Status window.
4. Pixel is the amount of pixel change it needs to count as kill, play around with this number, worked good for me with .5% (0.005 )

(Haven't tried AOE, Don't think it will work accurately with the method I'm using. Feel free to come with suggestions to track AOE as well!)

Happy Flyffing!
